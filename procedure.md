## Procedure

#### 1.	Click on the "Start" Button
- Begin the simulation by clicking the "Start" button.

#### 2.	Select the Appropriate Route for the Cabling. Please note while choosing the route care should be taken for tray support and no obstruction to any equipment in its operation
- Choose the best path for laying the cables.

#### 3.	Connect the Field Instrument (Red Circle) with the Junction Box. Please ensure that the junction box location is suitable for working and maintenance
- Click on the source and then the destination (junction box) to establish the connection.

#### 4.	Calculate the Required Length of the Cable (mm). The co-ordinates required to establish the accurate length are shared on screen
- Measure the length needed by considering the coordinates of the components and the junction box.

#### 5.	Repeat the above step for the remaining 7 field instruments
- Follow the same process for the remaining instruments.

#### 6.	Find the Total Length Required in Meters. Please ensure that the sufficient length is considered for termination in the junction box and spare length
- Sum up all the cable lengths to get the final total length in meters.

#### 7.	On the similar lines calculate the instrument air tubing length of HDPE required to supply air to six solenoid valves installed at the entry and exit of the vessels. The air header location is as shown in the diagram.
